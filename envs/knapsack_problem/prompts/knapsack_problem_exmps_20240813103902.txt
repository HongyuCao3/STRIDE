Now you are going to find the subset of items of [(5, 2), (6, 9), (14, 10), (1, 11), (5, 2), (4, 10), (6, 1), (6, 13), (4, 3), (3, 10), (7, 9), (4, 11), (7, 5), (8, 6)] that maximizes the total value without exceeding a given weight capacity 65.

Question: Which subset of items [(5, 2), (6, 9), (14, 10), (1, 11), (5, 2), (4, 10), (6, 1), (6, 13), (4, 3), (3, 10), (7, 9), (4, 11), (7, 5), (8, 6)] has the maximum value without exceeding the weight capacity 65?
Thought: I will solve this problem with dynamic programming. My strategy will be to iteratively find the maximum value that can be obtained using the first i items. I will iterate for 15 times. I will do this by updating a dynamic programming table called 'dp'. I need to initialize the 'dp' table.
Operation: call function Initial_Knapsack_DPTable with inputs {}.
