Now you are going to play in a finite-horizon dynamic mechanism design problem, with number of agents N=4, length of horizon 5 (with time indices starting from h=0 to 4), number of states |S|=3, number of actions |A|=3. The transition matrix P is:
stored in working memory. Full matrix is too large to be printed in context history.
and reward matrix R reported by the agents is
stored in working memory. Full matrix is too large to be printed in context history.

Question: Now compute the optimal policy that maximizes all agents' rewards.
Thought: We can compute the optimal policy by value iteration, which iterates from the last time step 4 back to the first time step 0. At the last time step 4, since the episode terminate at this step, the one-step lookahead is zero. Thus the Q values simply equal the immediate reward of each state-action pair. To compute the Q values, we only need to call function UpdateQbyRExcluding and add the immediate rewards of all agents. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateVExcluding, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyRExcluding with inputs {'time_step': 4, 'agent_to_exclude': None}.
Result: Q values for time step 4 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.

Thought: Step 2: we need to evaluate the policy that maximizes all agents' reward on the MDP that excludes agent 2's reward by calling function EvaluatePolicyExcluding.
Operation: call function EvaluatePolicyExcluding with inputs {'agent_to_exclude': 2}.
Result: The value of the optimal policy on the MDP that excludes agent 2's reward is -1.0438572711858918.
Thought: In Step 1, we have computed the value of the policy that maximizes all agents' rewards except agent 2, which is 4.7078, and in Step 2 we have computed the value of the policy that maximizes all agents' rewards including agent 2, which is -1.0438572711858918. The VCG price is simply their difference 4.7078--1.0438572711858918=5.751657271185891.

Question: Now compute the VCG price for agent 3.
Thought: Step 1: Compute the policy that maximizes the rewards of all agents excluding agent 3 by value iteration, which iterates from the last time step 4 back to the first time step 0. At the last time step 4 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0), since the episode terminate at this step, the one-step lookahead is zero. Thus the Q values simply equal the immediate reward of each state-action pair. To compute the Q values, we only need to add the immediate rewards of all agents excluding agent 3 by calling function UpdateQbyRExcluding. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateVExcluding.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyRExcluding with inputs {'time_step': 4, 'agent_to_exclude': 3}.
Result: Q values for time step 4 are updated with the immediate rewards excluding agent 3 and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateVExcluding with inputs {'time_step': 4, 'agent_to_exclude': 3}.
Result: V values for time step 4 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: Now we compute Q values for time step 3 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0). Using the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards of all agents excluding agent 3 by calling function UpdateQbyRExcluding. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPVExcluding. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateVExcluding.
