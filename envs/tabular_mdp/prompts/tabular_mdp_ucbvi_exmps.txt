Now you are going to play in a finite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, with length of horizon H=10 (with time indices starting from h=0 to 9), number of states |S|=3, number of actions |A|=3. The transition matrix P and reward matrix R are unknown to you.

==== USER ====
Question: Now compute the optimistic policy based on your current estimation of transition function P and reward function R.
Thought: We can compute the optimistic policy by upper confidence bound value iteration, which iterates from the last time step 9 back to the first time step 0. At the last time step 9, since the episode terminate at this step, the one-step lookahead is zero. Thus the Q values simply equal the immediate reward of each state-action pair plus the exploration bonus. We need to call function UpdateQbyR to add the immediate rewards and call function UpdateQbyBonus to add the exploration bonus. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 9}.
Result: Q values for time step 9 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyBonus with inputs {'time_step': 9}.
