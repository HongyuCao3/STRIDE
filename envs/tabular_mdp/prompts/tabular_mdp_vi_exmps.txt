Now you are going to play in a finite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, with length of horizon 5 (with time indices starting from h=0 to 4), number of states |S|=5, number of actions |A|=5. The transition matrix P is:
stored in working memory. Full matrix is too large to be printed in context history.
and reward matrix R is
stored in working memory. Full matrix is too large to be printed in context history.

Question: Now compute the optimal policy, that is, the optimal action at each step and each state.
Thought: We can compute the optimal policy by value iteration, which iterates from the last time step 4 back to the first time step 0. At the last time step 4, since the episode terminate at this step, the one-step lookahead is zero. Thus the Q values simply equal the immediate reward of each state-action pair. To compute the Q values, we only need to call function UpdateQbyR to add the immediate rewards. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 4}.
Result: Q values for time step 4 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateV with inputs {'time_step': 4}.
Result: V values for time step 4 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: Now we need to compute the Q values for time step 3 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0). Using the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards by calling function UpdateQbyR. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPV. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 3}.
Result: Q values for time step 3 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyPV with inputs {'time_step': 3}.
Result: Q values for time step 3 are updated with the one-step look ahead and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateV with inputs {'time_step': 3}.
Result: V values for time step 3 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: Now we need to compute the Q values for time step 2 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0). Using the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards by calling function UpdateQbyR. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPV. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 2}.
Result: Q values for time step 2 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyPV with inputs {'time_step': 2}.
Result: Q values for time step 2 are updated with the one-step look ahead and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateV with inputs {'time_step': 2}.
Result: V values for time step 2 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: Now we need to compute the Q values for time step 1 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0). Using the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards by calling function UpdateQbyR. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPV. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 1}.
Result: Q values for time step 1 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyPV with inputs {'time_step': 1}.
Result: Q values for time step 1 are updated with the one-step look ahead and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateV with inputs {'time_step': 1}.
Result: V values for time step 1 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: Now we need to compute the Q values for time step 0 (we can only exit the reasoning process after computing the Q values for time step 0). Using the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards by calling function UpdateQbyR. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPV. Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyR with inputs {'time_step': 0}.
Result: Q values for time step 0 are updated with the immediate rewards and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateQbyPV with inputs {'time_step': 0}.
Result: Q values for time step 0 are updated with the one-step look ahead and stored in the working memory.
Operation: call function UpdateV with inputs {'time_step': 0}.
Result: V values for time step 0 are updated based on the computed Q values and stored in the working memory.
Thought: The Q values from the last time step 4 to time step 0 have now been calculated. We should exit the reasoning process.
