Now you are going to play in a finite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, with length of horizon 5 (with time indices starting from h=0 to 4), number of states |S|=3, number of actions |A|=3. The transition matrix P is:
[[[0.68 0.00 0.32]
  [0.41 0.00 0.59]
  [0.66 0.15 0.19]]

 [[0.00 0.00 1.00]
  [0.43 0.39 0.18]
  [0.00 1.00 0.00]]

 [[0.00 0.00 1.00]
  [0.19 0.64 0.17]
  [0.56 0.08 0.36]]]
and reward matrix R is
[[ 0.68  0.45  0.74]
 [-0.89  0.98 -0.48]
 [ 0.55  0.16  0.23]]

Question: Now compute the optimal policy, that is, the optimal action at each step and each state.
Thought: We can compute the optimal policy by value iteration, which iterates from the last time step 4 back to the first time step 0. **At the last time step 4**, since the episode terminate at this step, the one-step lookahead is zero. Thus the Q values simply equal the immediate reward of each state-action pair. To compute the Q values, we only need to **First** call function UpdateQbyR to add the immediate rewards, **Second** then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions. **For time step <range_iterator object at 0x160508330>**, under the idea of dynamic programming, we compute the Q values in two steps. **First**, add the immediate rewards by calling function UpdateQbyR. **Second** add the one-step lookahead by calling function UpdateQbyPV. **Third** Then the V values can be computed by calling UpdateV, which takes maximum of the Q values over actions.

This is time step 0, the current state is 0, and the available actions are [0, 1, 2].
Question: Now which action the agent should take?
Thought: **First** I should retrieve the Q values for current state, which is 0, and time step, which is 0. **Second** Then I should call function GetArgMax to get the action indices corresponding to the maximal value in the result list obtained from the retrieved Q values.
Operation Branch: {'condition': 'time_step=0, state=0', 'operations': ['GetQ', 'GetArgMax']}
