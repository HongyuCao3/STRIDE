Question: What is the minimum number of operations needed for transforming string A = 'jjukonwsqepn' to string B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'?
Thought: I will use dynamic programming for solving this problem. My strategy will be to find the edit distance between each substring of A and all the subtrings of B. I need to initialize the dp table which it's dimensions are [(length_of_A+1,length_of_B+1) that is [13,13]].
Operation: call function InitialDPTable with inputs {}.
Result: So 'dp' is now initialized.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 1 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 1}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'j' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 2 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 2}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jj' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 3 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 3}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jju' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 4 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 4}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjuk' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 5 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 5}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjuko' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 6 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 6}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukon' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 7 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 7}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonw' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 8 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 8}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonws' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 9 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 9}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonwsq' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 10 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 10}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonwsqe' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 11 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 11}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonwsqep' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: I will find the edit distance between the first 12 characters of A  = 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Operation: call function UpdateDPTable with inputs {'character_index': 12}.
Result: dp table is updated after finding the edit distance between 'jjukonwsqepn' and all the substrings of B = 'jprxcgvxpnis'.
Thought: The edit distance is 11.
