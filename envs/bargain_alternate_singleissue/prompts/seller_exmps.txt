This is the beginning of a new game instance, where you will play as the seller. Your discount factor delta_s=0.97, buyer's discount factor delta_b=0.8, and the deadline T=3.
Question: Now compute the subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) for each time step.
==== ASSISTANT ====
Thought: We can compute the SPE via backward induction from the last time step 3 to time step 1. Since t=3 is odd, it will be buyer's turn to make the final offer. I will get 0 utility if rejecting buyer's offer. Therefore, we can compute buyer's optimal price at time step 3 by calling BackwardOneStep, and then compute the corresponding utility by calling CalcUtil.
Operation: call function BackwardOneStep with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'opponent_util_if_rej': 0.0, 'time_step': 3}.
Result: The SPE price of buyer at time step 3 is 0.0
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'price': 0.0, 'time_step': 3}.
Result: The utility that buyer gets for agreeing on price 0.0 at time step 3 is 0.64
Thought: Now we move one time step back to t=2, which is my turn to make an offer. Based on our reasoning for time step t=3, buyer would get a utility of 0.64 if the game continues to time step t=3. Therefore, we can compute my optimal price at time step 2 by calling BackwardOneStep, and then compute the corresponding utility by calling CalcUtil.
Operation: call function BackwardOneStep with inputs {'agent': 'seller', 'opponent_util_if_rej': 0.64, 'time_step': 2}.
Result: The SPE price of seller at time step 2 is 0.2
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'seller', 'price': 0.2, 'time_step': 2}.
Result: The utility that seller gets for agreeing on price 0.2 at time step 2 is 0.194
Thought: Now we move one time step back to t=1, which is the buyer's turn to make an offer. Based on our reasoning for time step t=2, I would get a utility of 0.194 if the game continues to time step t=2. Therefore, we can compute buyer's optimal price at time step 1 by calling BackwardOneStep, and then compute the corresponding utility by calling CalcUtil.
Operation: call function BackwardOneStep with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'opponent_util_if_rej': 0.194, 'time_step': 1}.
Result: The SPE price of buyer at time step 1 is 0.194
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'price': 0.194, 'time_step': 1}.
Result: The utility that buyer gets for agreeing on price 0.194 at time step 1 is 0.806
Thought: I have finished my reasoning from the last time step t=3 to time step t=1, so I can exit the reasoning process, and save the computed subgame perfect equilibrium strategy in my working memory.
==== USER ====
Question: This time step 1, and buyer has proposed a price of 0.54. Now the seller needs to decide whether to accept it or reject it.
==== ASSISTANT ====
Thought: I should compare the utility I can get by accepting this price vs the utility I can get by rejecting it and making a counteroffer in the next time step. First, let me compute my utility for accepting the price of 0.54 at the current time step 1 by calling CalcUtil.
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'seller', 'price': 0.54, 'time_step': 1}.
Result: The utility that seller gets for agreeing on price 0.54 at time step 1 is 0.54
Thought: Then I should reason about the utility I can get by rejecting and making a counteroffer at the next time step 2. Since I have already computed the subgame perfect equilirbium strategy and saved it in the working memory, I can retrive the previously computed price for the next time step 2 by calling GetSPEPrice. Then I can compute my utility by calling CalcUtil.
Operation: call function GetSPEPrice with inputs {'agent': 'seller', 'time_step': 2}.
Result: The SPE price of seller at time step 2 is 0.2
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'seller', 'price': 0.2, 'time_step': 2}.
Result: The utility that seller gets for agreeing on price 0.2 at time step 2 is 0.194
Thought: Since the utility I get by accepting the offer is greater or equal to that of rejecting the offer, I can exit the reasoning process and choose to accept the offer.
