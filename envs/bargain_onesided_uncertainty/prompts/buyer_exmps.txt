Question: This is time step 1. Seller has offered a price of 0.3892394738435474 to the buyer. Now the buyer needs to decide whether to accept it or reject it
Thought: To make this decision, I need to first reason about the utility I can get by accepting the offer now, and the utility I can get by rejecting it and waiting for the next time step.
Operation: Call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'price': 0.3892394738435474, 'time_step': 1}.
Result: The utility that buyer gets for agreeing on price 0.3892394738435474 at time step 1 is 0.3808
Thought: Now, to know the utility I can get by rejecting the offer at current time step 1 and waiting for seller's new offer at time step 2, I need to first compute what seller's belief at time step T-1 about my value would be. I can achieve this via bisection search that terminates when I get close enough (the difference is smaller than 0.01) to the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. My value is in the range of [0,1], so I should start with (0+1)/2=0.5. Then I should call function ComputeBt to compute what seller's current belief about my value would be, assuming that seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.5.Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'b_last': 0.5}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.5, then the current belief should be 21.392093054607507
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 21.392093054607507 is larger than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of my value range [0, 0.5], and try (0+0.5)/2.0=0.25.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.25}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.25, then the current belief should be 10.696046527303753
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 10.696046527303753 is larger than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of my value range [0, 0.25], and try (0+0.25)/2.0=0.125.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.125}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.125, then the current belief should be 5.348023263651877
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 5.348023263651877 is larger than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of my value range [0, 0.125], and try (0+0.125)/2.0=0.0625.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.0625}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.0625, then the current belief should be 2.6740116318259384
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 2.6740116318259384 is larger than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of my value range [0, 0.0625], and try (0+0.0625)/2.0=0.03125.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.03125}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.03125, then the current belief should be 1.3370058159129692
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 1.3370058159129692 is larger than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of my value range [0, 0.03125], and try (0+0.03125)/2.0=0.015625.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.015625}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.015625, then the current belief should be 0.6685029079564846
Thought: Since the computed value of seller's current belief 0.6685029079564846 is smaller than the actual value of seller's current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the upper half of my value range [0.015625, 0.03125], and try (0.015625+0.03125)/2.0=0.0234375.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.0234375}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.0234375, then the current belief should be 1.002754361934727
Thought: Since |1.002754361934727-1.0| < 0.01, the computed value of seller's current belief is close enough to the actual value now. Therefore, 0.0234375 is an accurate approximation of seller's belief about my value at time step T-1.
Operation: Call function SOLVELAST with inputs {'b_last': 0.0234375}.
Result: At the last time step 9, seller's expected utility is 0.00012793365561615 and the corresponding price is 0.01171875Thought: Now I need to continue to time step 8.

Result: At time step 5, seller's expected utility is 0.0033409892530619923 and the corresponding price is 0.05857776463378603
Thought: Now I need to continue to time step 4.
Operation: Call function SOLVE with inputs {'u_t': 0.0033409892530619923, 'p_t': 0.05857776463378603, 't': 4}.
Result: At time step 4, seller's expected utility is 0.008748403706496816 and the corresponding price is 0.093385944434907
Thought: Now I need to continue to time step 3.
Operation: Call function SOLVE with inputs {'u_t': 0.008748403706496816, 'p_t': 0.093385944434907, 't': 3}.
Result: At time step 3, seller's expected utility is 0.02319698552903191 and the corresponding price is 0.14985073338860855
Thought: Now I need to continue to time step 2.
Operation: Call function SOLVE with inputs {'u_t': 0.02319698552903191, 'p_t': 0.14985073338860855, 't': 2}.
Result: At time step 2, seller's expected utility is 0.06248742411637151 and the corresponding price is 0.2412905622060917
Thought: I have reached the next time step 2. Seller will offer a price of 0.2412905622060917 in the next time step. Now I need to calculate my utility if I accept this price at the next time step 2.
Operation: call function CalcUtil with inputs {'agent': 'buyer', 'price': 0.2412905622060917, 'time_step': 2}.
Result: The utility that buyer gets for agreeing on price 0.2412905622060917 at time step 2 is 0.3225
Thought: Since the utility of accepting seller's offer at the current time step 1, which is 0.3807605261564526, is greater or equal to the utility of waiting for seller's offer at next time step 2, which is 0.32251275705428406, I can exit reasoning process and choose to accept.
