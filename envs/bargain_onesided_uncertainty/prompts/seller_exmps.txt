This is the beginning of a new game instance, where you will play as the seller. Your discount factor delta_s=0.62, buyer's discount factor delta_b=0.61, and the deadline T=9. The buyer's value b is unknown to you, but you know it is uniformly sampled from [0,1]

Question: This is time step 1. Now seller needs to propose a price in the range of [0.0, 1.0] to the buyer.
Thought: To decide my price at the current time step 1, I need to first compute my belief about buyer's value at time step T-1 under sequential equilbrium. I can achieve this via bisection search that terminates when I get close enough (the difference is smaller than 0.01) to the actual value of my current belief 1.0. Buyer's value is in the range of [0,1], so I should start with (0+1)/2=0.5. Then I should call function ComputeBt to compute what my current belief about buyer's value would be, assuming that my belief at time step T-1 is 0.5.Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.5}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.5, then the current belief should be 21.392093054607507
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 21.392093054607507 is larger than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of buyer's value range [0, 0.5], and try (0+0.5)/2.0=0.25.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.25}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.25, then the current belief should be 10.696046527303753
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 10.696046527303753 is larger than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of buyer's value range [0, 0.25], and try (0+0.25)/2.0=0.125.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.125}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.125, then the current belief should be 5.348023263651877
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 5.348023263651877 is larger than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of buyer's value range [0, 0.125], and try (0+0.125)/2.0=0.0625.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.0625}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.0625, then the current belief should be 2.6740116318259384
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 2.6740116318259384 is larger than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of buyer's value range [0, 0.0625], and try (0+0.0625)/2.0=0.03125.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.03125}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.03125, then the current belief should be 1.3370058159129692
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 1.3370058159129692 is larger than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the lower half of buyer's value range [0, 0.03125], and try (0+0.03125)/2.0=0.015625.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.015625}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.015625, then the current belief should be 0.6685029079564846
Thought: Since the computed value of my current belief 0.6685029079564846 is smaller than the actual value of my current belief 1.0. In next iteration, I should focus on the upper half of buyer's value range [0.015625, 0.03125], and try (0.015625+0.03125)/2.0=0.0234375.
Operation: Call function ComputeBt with inputs {'time_step': 1, 'b_last': 0.0234375}.
Result: If seller's belief at time step T-1 is 0.0234375, then the current belief should be 1.002754361934727
Thought: Since |1.002754361934727-1.0| < 0.01, the computed value of my current belief is close enough to the actual value now. Therefore, 0.0234375 is an accurate approximation of my belief about buyer's value at time step T-1.
Thought: Now I can start reasoning backward from the last time step 9 to the current time step 1 to compute the price I should offer at current time step 1.
Operation: Call function SOLVELAST with inputs {'b_last': 0.0234375}.
Result: At the last time step 9, seller's expected utility is 0.00012793365561615 and the corresponding price is 0.01171875Thought: Now I need to continue to time step 8.
