Now you are going to find the most efficient path between vertice start = 0 and vertice end = 13 in a weighted graph

Question: What is the shortest distance between vertex 'start' = 0 and 'end' = 13 in graph G?
Thought: I will use Dijkstra's algorithm for solving this problem. I will use a dictionary called 'dists' for storing the distances from the starting point in the working memory. I need to initialize 'dists'.
Operation: call function InitDistTable with inputs {}.
Thought: I will use a priority que for checking the nodes. I have to push the start node = 0 with distance 0 in the que
Operation: call function PushinQue with inputs {'node': 0, 'distance': 0}
Results: The start node is pushed!
Thought: Now lets check whether the que is empty or not.
Operation: call function isQueempty with inputs {}
Result: The que is not empty
Thought: I have to pop the node from the que.
Operation: call function PoPfromQue with inputs {}
